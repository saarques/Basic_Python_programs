# Software Engineering

*Software* is more than just a program code. A program is an executable code, which serves some computational purpose. Software is considered to be collection of executable programming code, associated libraries and documentations. Software, when made for a specific requirement is called software product.

*Engineering* on the other hand, is all about developing products, using well-defined, scientific principles and methods.

*Software engineering* is an engineering branch associated with development of software product using well-defined scientific principles, methods and procedures. The outcome of software engineering is an efficient and reliable software product.

## Software Evolution

The process of developing a software product using software engineering principles and methods is referred to as software evolution. This includes the initial development of software and its maintenance and updates, till desired software product is developed, which satisfies the expected requirements.

## Software Evolution Laws

Lehman has given laws for software evolution. He divided the software into three different categories:

*S-type(static-type)*
*P-type(Practical-type)*
*E-Type(embedded-type)*

## E-Type software evolution
Lehman has given eight laws for E-Type software evolution - 

### Continuing change
### Increasing complexity
### Conservation of familiarity
### Continuing Growth
### Reducing Quality
### Feedback Systems
### Self-Regulation
### Organizational stability

## Software Development Paradigm

This Paradigm is known as software engineering paradigms where all the engineering concepts pertaining to the development of software are applied. It includes various researches and requirement gathering which helps the software product to build. It consists of –

    Requirement gathering
    Software design
    Programming

Software Design Paradigm

This paradigm is a part of Software Development and includes –

    Design
    Maintenance
    Programming

Programming Paradigm

This paradigm is related closely to programming aspect of software development. This includes –

    Coding
    Testing
    Integration


## Need of Software Engineering

THe need of software engineering arises because of higher rate of change in user requirements and environment on which the software is working.

### Large Software
### Scalability
### Cost
### Dynamic Nature
### Quality Management

## Characteristics of Good Software

A software product can be judged by what it offers and how well it can be used. This software must satisfy on the following grounds:

### Operational
### Transitional
### Maintenance
